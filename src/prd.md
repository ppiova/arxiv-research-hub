# arXiv Research Discovery - Product Requirements Document

## Core Purpose & Success
- **Mission Statement**: Provide researchers and academics with an intuitive interface to discover and explore the latest papers from arXiv by topic and relevance.
- **Success Indicators**: Users can efficiently find relevant papers through both chronological and relevance-based browsing, with advanced filtering capabilities.
- **Experience Qualities**: Clean, fast, informative - prioritizing content discovery without distractions.

## Project Classification & Approach
- **Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
- **Primary User Activity**: Consuming and Acting (discovering papers, accessing PDFs)

## Thought Process for Feature Selection
- **Core Problem Analysis**: Researchers need better ways to discover relevant papers beyond just chronological listing
- **User Context**: Academic researchers looking for papers in specific domains with time-sensitive relevance
- **Critical Path**: Browse topic → Filter by relevance/date → Preview abstract → Access paper
- **Key Moments**: 
  1. Topic selection and mode switching
  2. Relevance filtering with date constraints
  3. Paper preview and access

## Essential Features

### Core Discovery Features
- **Topic-based browsing**: 8 curated research areas with domain-specific categorization
- **Dual sorting modes**: Latest submissions vs. relevance-based ranking
- **Date-constrained relevance**: Smart filtering for recent relevant work
- **Keyword enhancement**: Topic-specific and custom keyword filtering
- **Search functionality**: Global search across all papers
- **Pagination**: Load-more pattern for large result sets

### Advanced Filtering (NEW)
- **Relevance Mode**: Sort by arXiv's relevance algorithm within date constraints
- **Smart Date Ranges**: Quick presets (7, 14, 30 days) plus custom date picker
- **Keyword Suggestions**: Domain-specific suggested keywords per topic
- **Custom Keywords**: User-defined keyword filtering
- **Filter State Management**: Persistent filter state during navigation

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Professional confidence with approachable clarity
- **Design Personality**: Academic precision meets modern usability
- **Visual Metaphors**: Research organization and knowledge discovery
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Clean minimal interface that showcases content

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Monochromatic with subtle accent colors
- **Primary Color**: Deep blue (academic trust and professionalism)
- **Secondary Colors**: Neutral grays for content hierarchy
- **Accent Color**: Warm amber for highlights and active states
- **Color Psychology**: Blue conveys trust and authority, amber provides warmth
- **Theme Support**: Complete dark/light mode implementation

### Typography System
- **Font Selection**: Inter for excellent readability across sizes
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between titles, metadata, and body content
- **Readability Focus**: Optimal line spacing and contrast for extended reading

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Mode Toggle**: Clean tab-style selector for Latest vs Relevance
- **Date Controls**: Intuitive preset buttons with optional custom date picker
- **Keyword Chips**: Removable filter tags with visual feedback
- **Paper Cards**: Information-dense cards with clear action hierarchy
- **Loading States**: Skeleton placeholders maintaining layout stability

## Implementation Architecture

### Backend Query Building
- **Smart Query Construction**: Context-aware arXiv API query building
- **Category Mapping**: Domain-specific arXiv category targeting
- **Date Range Formatting**: Proper YYYYMMDD formatting for arXiv API
- **Keyword Processing**: Escaped and OR-combined keyword queries
- **Cache Strategy**: Intelligent caching based on query parameters

### State Management
- **Filter Persistence**: Maintain user selections during navigation
- **Mode-Aware Defaults**: Smart defaults when switching between modes
- **Search Integration**: Seamless search with filter combinations
- **Pagination Handling**: Proper page-based loading with cache keys

### Query Examples
- Latest mode: `cat:cs.CL AND sortBy=submittedDate`
- Relevance mode: `cat:cs.CL AND submittedDate:[20240101 TO 20240131] AND all:("transformer" OR "LLM") AND sortBy=relevance`

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
- **Network failures**: Graceful degradation with retry mechanisms
- **Empty results**: Helpful messaging with alternative actions
- **API rate limits**: Appropriate caching to minimize requests
- **Date validation**: Prevent invalid date ranges in custom picker
- **Keyword conflicts**: Handle overlapping search and filter keywords

## Testing Strategy
- **Query Builder Tests**: Validate URL construction for all parameter combinations
- **Cache Behavior**: Ensure cache keys properly differentiate query variations
- **UI State Management**: Test filter state persistence and mode switching
- **Date Range Logic**: Validate preset and custom date range calculations

## Success Metrics
- **User Engagement**: Time spent browsing and papers accessed
- **Feature Adoption**: Usage of relevance mode vs. latest mode
- **Filter Utilization**: Keyword and date filter usage patterns
- **Error Rates**: API failures and recovery success rates

## Accessibility & Performance
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard access to all filtering controls
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper labeling of dynamic filter states
- **Performance**: Optimized caching to minimize API calls
- **Responsive Design**: Functional across desktop and mobile devices

## Future Considerations
- **Saved Searches**: Bookmark specific filter combinations
- **Paper Collections**: User-curated paper lists
- **Export Features**: Generate bibliography from paper lists
- **Notification System**: Alerts for new papers matching saved searches
