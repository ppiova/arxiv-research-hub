# arXiv Research Papers Discovery App

A comprehensive web application for discovering and browsing the latest research papers from arXiv organized by research domains.

**Experience Qualities**:
1. **Efficient** - Quick discovery of relevant papers with minimal friction
2. **Organized** - Clear categorization by research domains for focused browsing
3. **Responsive** - Fast loading with smart caching and progressive content loading

**Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
This app manages multiple data streams (different research topics), implements caching, search functionality, and pagination while maintaining a focused single-purpose interface.

## Essential Features

**Topic-Based Paper Browsing**
- Functionality: Display latest papers organized by research domain tabs
- Purpose: Enable researchers to quickly find papers in their field of interest
- Trigger: User clicks on topic tabs (LLMs & NLP, Computer Vision, etc.)
- Progression: Tab selection → API call → Parse arXiv feed → Display paper cards → Cache results
- Success criteria: Papers load within 2 seconds, cache prevents redundant API calls for 10 minutes

**Paper Search**
- Functionality: Search papers by keywords across all topics
- Purpose: Find specific papers when browsing by topic isn't sufficient
- Trigger: User types in search input and submits
- Progression: Keyword input → API call with search query → Parse results → Display with pagination
- Success criteria: Search returns relevant results, supports "Load More" for pagination

**Paper Information Display**
- Functionality: Show paper details in organized cards
- Purpose: Present key information for quick paper evaluation
- Trigger: Successful API response
- Progression: Data received → Extract title/authors/date/categories → Render card → Provide PDF/abstract links
- Success criteria: All paper metadata displayed clearly, links work correctly

**Server-Side API Integration**
- Functionality: Backend endpoint that queries arXiv API and caches results
- Purpose: Reduce client-side complexity and improve performance through caching
- Trigger: Frontend requests papers for specific topic or search
- Progression: Request received → Check cache → Query arXiv if needed → Parse Atom feed → Return JSON → Update cache
- Success criteria: 10-minute cache works correctly, handles arXiv API failures gracefully

## Edge Case Handling

- **Network failures**: Show retry button with clear error message
- **Empty search results**: Display helpful message suggesting different keywords
- **API rate limiting**: Implement exponential backoff and show appropriate user feedback
- **Malformed arXiv responses**: Graceful parsing with fallback values for missing fields
- **Slow connections**: Show loading skeletons and progress indicators

## Design Direction

The design should feel academic yet modern - professional and information-dense while remaining approachable and easy to scan.

## Color Selection

Triadic color scheme optimized for readability and academic context with support for dark mode.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Blue (oklch(0.45 0.15 240)) - Communicates trust and academic authority
- **Secondary Colors**: Muted Gray (oklch(0.6 0.02 240)) for backgrounds and subtle elements
- **Accent Color**: Vibrant Orange (oklch(0.7 0.15 45)) - Attention-grabbing for CTAs and important actions
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background Light (oklch(0.98 0.005 240)): Dark Gray text (oklch(0.2 0.02 240)) - Ratio 8.2:1 ✓
  - Background Dark (oklch(0.15 0.02 240)): Light Gray text (oklch(0.9 0.01 240)) - Ratio 7.1:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Blue): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 5.8:1 ✓
  - Accent (Vibrant Orange): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 4.9:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Clean, academic typography that prioritizes readability for dense technical content using Inter for its excellent screen readability.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**: 
  - H1 (App Title): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Paper Titles): Inter SemiBold/20px/normal letter spacing  
  - H3 (Section Headers): Inter Medium/16px/wide letter spacing
  - Body (Paper Content): Inter Regular/14px/normal letter spacing
  - Caption (Metadata): Inter Regular/12px/normal letter spacing

## Animations

Subtle, purposeful animations that enhance usability without distraction - focusing on state transitions and loading feedback.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Smooth tab transitions communicate topic switching, loading animations provide feedback during API calls
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Paper cards have subtle hover effects, primary actions (PDF buttons) have prominent interactive feedback

## Component Selection

- **Components**: Tabs for topic navigation, Card for paper display, Button for actions, Input for search, Badge for categories, Skeleton for loading states
- **Customizations**: Custom paper card component with structured layout, search bar with integrated loading state
- **States**: Buttons show loading/disabled states during API calls, cards have hover effects, inputs show focus states
- **Icon Selection**: Search icon for search input, external link for PDF/abstract buttons, calendar for dates, user group for authors
- **Spacing**: Consistent 4px base spacing scale - 16px for cards, 8px for internal padding, 24px for section separation
- **Mobile**: Responsive grid that adapts from 3 columns to 1 column, collapsible search bar, touch-friendly button sizes
